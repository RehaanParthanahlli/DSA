HASHING PERFECTION MASTER PLAN — 6 COMPLETE DAWNS
============================================================

GOAL: HashMap mastery for ALL interview patterns

**DAWN 1: FREQUENCY COUNTING**
Coverage: Basic hash usage
Problems:
1. Two Sum (1)
2. Contains Duplicate (217)
3. Group Anagrams (49)
Rules: Counter = collections.Counter()
Outcome: Frequency → hashmap instinct

**DAWN 2: SLIDING WINDOW + HASH**
Coverage: Fixed/variable window
Problems:
1. Longest Substring Without Repeat (3)
2. Subarray Sum Equals K (560)
3. Longest Repeating Replacement (424)
Rules: hashmap + prefix sum
Outcome: Window maintainance O(1)

**DAWN 3: TWO POINTER + HASH**
Coverage: Sorted + hash lookup
Problems:
1. 3Sum (15)
2. 4Sum (18)
3. Subarray Product Less Than K (713)
Rules: Hash complements sorting
Outcome: Hybrid pattern recognition

**DAWN 4: GRAPH + UNION-FIND HASH**
Coverage: Connectivity via hash
Problems:
1. Accounts Merge (721)
2. Evaluate Division (399)
3. Fraction to Recurring Decimal (166)
Rules: Hash keys = tuple/frozen set
Outcome: Complex key hashing

**DAWN 5: LRU + DESIGN PATTERNS**
Coverage: Hash + DLL/heap
Problems:
1. LRU Cache (146)
2. Design HashMap (706)
3. LFU Cache (460)
Rules: O(1) get/put guaranteed
Outcome: Hash-based cache design

**DAWN 6: COMPETITION + SPEED**
1. Top K Frequent Elements (347)
2. Encode Decode Strings (271)
3. Codeforces Hashing 800-1300 (12 problems)
Rules: <10min per problem
Outcome: Hashing perfection certified
